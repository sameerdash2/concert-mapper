# Concert Mapper

A web app that maps out the locations of concerts by a given artist. View concerts as pins on an interactive map, and click pins to learn more about each concert (date, venue, setlists). The app uses the [setlist.fm API](https://api.setlist.fm/docs/1.0/index.html) to get concert data.

Made using Flask, Vue, and Leaflet.

## Build
